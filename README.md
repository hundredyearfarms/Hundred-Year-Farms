## Overview

Hundred Year Farms refers to two small farm properties (each about 43 acres); one on Prince Edward Island and the other in Manitoba. For both farms our plan is to make a gradual transition to Agroforestry.  Agroforesty involves the planting of crops, including grains, fruits, or vegetables, between rows of trees.  We believe that this type of farming, when combined with a greenhouse, can be made so that it becomes carbon-negative while maintaining food production, rebuilding topsoil, and maintaining habitat. That, over the next 100 years, should lead to higher long-term asset values than would otherwise be the case and make the farms more interesting to live on and visit.

**Farm Plans**

Our plan for the island farm, as shown by the superposition of trees onto the sattelite image below, is to plant strong wind-break trees along the uppermost ridge with the trees and crops that require more sunlight and wind protection located lower on the farm's south sloping land. The existing trees are a near single species of spruce resulting from a prior clear-cut, but the new trees will be a more diverse mix of native species.  The trees in rows will be arranged to allow for selective harvesting while some blocks will be left to grow unmanaged.  A greenhouse will be incorporated into this agroforestry system.

A - water erosion down the centre of this field is already evident, but can be controlled by the new rows of trees that follow field contours. B - prior clear-cut area. C - windbreak realligned to follow land contours. D - Greenhouse.*

Some of the goals we are trying to achieve are:

- Erosion control: Trees in rows reduce wind speeds and slow drainage.  
- Reduced pest and fire risk: By increasing the number of tree species.  
- Level work: Greenhouses, trees, and field crops require work at different times of year.
- Higher asset values: Higher value trees, greenhouse, biodiveristy, and improved topsoil.  

Agroforestry is an established practice.  Where we will be doing original work is in our approach to supplying greenhouse utilities from the agro-forestry waste biomass.  Those utility services are what could allow small agroforestry farms to some day become carbon negative and more profitable.  

**Carbon-negative integrated greenhouse**

Agroforestry produces significant amounts of waste biomass that must be managed.  Through gassification this waste can be used to produce heat (e.g. for greenhouses), gas, electricity, treated water, fertilizer, and [char](https://biochar-international.org/sustainability-climate-change/) (solid carbon) which can be used as a carbon sequestering [soil ammendment or other products](https://national-carbon.com/). A schematic showing design objectives for our integrated greenhouse application is shown below.

</p>

The core technologies for using waste wood and waste crop biomass to provide utility services have received strong research and development support from governments where climate change is a priority.  That is because the technology is one of the very few that integrates so completely with the natural environment, can realistically become carbon-negative, be fabricated by any modern country with common metals, and deployed at scale.  A good summary of the gassification technology is provided by this [Energy and Environmental Science Article](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2016/ee/c6ee00935b) from the Royal Society of Chemistry.

- [Agroforestry for Biomass Production - Benefiting Canadians](https://www.aftaweb.org/latest-newsletter/temporate-agroforester/97-2008-vol-17/april-no-1/74-agroforestry-for-biomass-production-benefiting-canadians.html)

However, while the core gassification technology is proven, practical systems today remain cost-prohibitive.  Some cost-reduction will be achieved over the next few decades through improvements to equipment, but faster and more significant cost reductions are likely to be from:

1. Improving system integration to provide all utility services as illustrated above. 
1. Using automation (e.g. Smart Contracts) to lower the cost of project capital and administration. 

The diagram below expands upon the second bullet.  The first panel in the diagram depicts conventional project financing from investor shares.  The second panel depicts a form of financing, known as a cooperative, that is sometimes used when a project's returns are too low to interest investor-led financing, but where there is a high social purpose.  The third panel proposes to lower the administrative cost of social purpose cooperatives using smart contracts.

</p>

A recent (2020) example of cooperative financing, using a project structure similiar to that in the second panel, is given by the [low-carbon biogas-from-waste project](https://www.torontozoo.com/tz/biogas) at the Toronto Zoo.  They were able to organize their project as a cooperative since their project had a social purpose and that allowed them to raise money by selling bonds at 5% as opposed to the 15% or more that an investor led project would requiree.  Smart contracts, as shown in the third panel, have the potential to further lower the cost of social purpose (e.g. carbon negative) cooperatives.  

- [US Federal Reserve - Smart Contract Research Report](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/2021/02/05/decentralized-finance-on-blockchain-and-smart-contract-based-financial-markets)
- [OASIS Standards Body - Baseline Protocol for Smart Contracts](https://docs.baseline-protocol.org/baseline-protocol/architecture)
- [Ernst & Younge Blockchain Initiative](https://blockchain.ey.com/)

The agroforestry portion of our project will be implemented over the course of this decade, however, the integrated greenhouse will wait until a workable system design has been sucessfully modelled and smart contracts are available to lower project cost.

**Data**

We use a 3D file system based on [Building Information Management (BIM) IFC5 - scope includes infrastructure and landscaping](https://www.buildingsmart.org/ifc-for-site-landscape-and-urban-planning-call-for-participation/).   

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hundredyearfarms/Hundred-Year-Farms/main/BIM-githubReadme.svg" alt="BIM Models" width="600">
</p>

The main purpose of that file system is to manage the farm's asset data over time (e.g. trees, soil conditions, crop yields, and infrastructure) as shown in the panel to the left.  However, BIM tools (e.g. FreeCAD, Blender), are also useful for the design of out-buildings (greenhouses, sheds, workshop, garage,...) as shown in the panel to the right and will be especially useful for design of the engineered vessel and piping systems.

## Owners

Nancy and Brenon Knaggs both grew up on small farms. During their working careers Nancy helped manage new technology product development. Brenon worked in the engineering design of low-carbon cogeneration power systems and later in project management for large public infrastructure projects. They both have a keen interest in the relation between small farms, communities, and biodiversity within a time of changing climate and technology.
