## Overview

Hundred Year Farms refers to two small farm properties (each about 43 acres); one on Prince Edward Island and the other in Manitoba. For both farms our plan is to make a gradual transition to Agroforestry.  Agroforesty involves the planting of varied crops, including grains, fruits, or vegetables, between rows of trees. Crop acreage will stay the same, however, through these changes there will be a better likelihood of maintaining the farm's food production, habitat, topsoil, and water as climate changes. That, in turn, should lead to higher asset values than would otherwise be the case, while making the farms more interesting to visit, and more enjoyable to live on, for the next 100 years.

## Farm Plan (PEI)

There are five basic types of agroforestry practices in North America: windbreaks, alley cropping, silvopasture, riparian buffers, and forest farming. Alley cropping, which is the cultivation of crops between rows of trees, will be used on the island farm.  

Our plan, as shown by the superposition of trees onto the sattelite image below, is to plant strong wind-break trees along the upper-most ridges with the trees and crops that require more sunlight and wind protection located lower on the farm's south sloping land. The existing trees are a near single species of spruce resulting from a prior clear-cut, but the new trees will be a diverse mix that may include maple, oak, poplar, birch, hemlock, and apple, among others.  The trees in rows will be arranged to allow for selective harvesting while some blocks will be left to grow unmanaged. Similiar to the trees, the crops that will be planted in the tree understory and between the rows of trees will also be more diverse.

<u>Image</u>: *Proposed new trees and storm-water collection pond laid over a sattelite image of the existing property on Prince Edward Island (gradient lines show how the land slopes toward the south where surface run-off water collects). A - water erosion down the centre of this field is already evident, but can be controlled by the new rows of trees that follow field contours. B - this prior clear-cut will be diversified to a range of native tree species. C - there will be relatively little change to this field apart from re-aligning the existing windbreak so it follows natural contours and then adding a second row at the lowest and steepest part of the field. D - Greenhouse.  Note that the proposed changes will be gradual and are likely to take decades to complete.*

Some reasons for our transition to agroforestry are listed below:

- Productivity: Trees will reduce the higher wind speeds expected in the future and they will slow drainage from more extreme rainfall, both of which will help control soil erosion.  The lower wind speeds will also reduce damage to wind sensitive crops and, while increased tree shade will slow the growth of some crops, it will be beneficial to others as mid-afternoons become hotter. 

- Biodiversity: A more diverse mix of plants and wildlife will help mitigate climate induced pest, disease, and fire risks while also making the property more interesting to live on or visit.  

- Diversify outputs: The farm will be more suited to grazing, while providing access to higher value wood, as well as fruit, vegetables, forage, or grains.  The expected outcome is lower, but more stable, sources of farm income.
  
- Time:  High-value trees require a long lead-time to grow and, as the climate changes, it could be increasingly difficult to establish the most desirable species.  

## Management

We are, or plan to, use these methods for managing our agroforesty practice.

**BIM (Building Information Management)**

Building Information Management (BIM) tools are being used for design of the farm layout, the buildings, and infrastructure, but with the eventual goal of using it to manage the farm's asset data over time (e.g. trees, soil conditions, crop yields, as well as buildings and infrastructure, ...). While often associated with the design of buildings, industry is expanding the underlying BIM file system ([IFC5](https://www.buildingsmart.org/ifc-for-site-landscape-and-urban-planning-call-for-participation/)) to also include infrastructure and landscaping, thereby making it relevant to agroforestry (especially where the IFC standard is used by local government for the surrounding public works). Apart from farm management, this 3D file system may prove useful to researchers studying, or modelling the performance of, urban and rural agroforestry with carbon-sequestration.  This git repository was set up to hold the workflow and FreeCAD/Blender model.

**Cogeneration of heat and power with carbon sinking**

Small farm agroforestry produces waste biomass that must be managed. Through gassification this debris can be used to produce heat (e.g. for greenhouses), electricity, and with some designs, [char](https://biochar-international.org/sustainability-climate-change/) (solid carbon) which can be used as a soil ammendment or sold as a [product](https://national-carbon.com/). This technology, while still early in development, is one of the very few that can realistically be carbon-negative while being cost-effective.  Some examples of what we are likely to follow are listed below.

**Smart Contracts**: Smart (automated) contracts that help manage project capital, when combined with the technologies that are now reorganizing supply chains, could make agroforestry more cost competitive and thus lead to higher rates of carbon capture. Smart contracts are in early development and will not mature for another decade or so, however, they are far enough along to begin planning for their use in project work.  We plan to use this technology, as it develops, to the extent practical.

## Owners

Nancy and Brenon Knaggs both grew up on small farms. During their working careers Nancy helped manage new technology product development. Brenon worked in the engineering design of cogeneration power systems and later in public infrastructure projects. They both have a keen interest in the relation between small farms, communities, and biodiversity within a time of changing climate and technology.
