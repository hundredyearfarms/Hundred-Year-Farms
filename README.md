## Overview

Hundred Year Farms refers to two small farm properties (each about 43 acres); one on Prince Edward Island and the other in Manitoba. For both farms our plan is to make a gradual transition to Agroforestry.  Agroforesty involves the planting of crops, including grains, fruits, or vegetables, between rows of trees. We believe that, over the long-term, we can make this type of farming carbon-negative with the use of advanced co-generation and the emerging smart-contract technologies.

This transition to carbon-negative agroforestry will help maintain the farm's habitat, conserve water, and allow us to build high-value topsoil as the climate changes. That, in turn, should lead to higher long-term asset values than would otherwise be the case, while making the farms more interesting and more enjoyable to visit for the next 100 years.

## Farm Plan (PEI)

There are five basic types of agroforestry practices in North America: windbreaks, alley cropping, silvopasture, riparian buffers, and forest farming. Alley cropping, which is the cultivation of crops between rows of trees, will be used on the island farm.  

Our plan for the island farm, as shown by the superposition of trees onto the sattelite image below, is to plant strong wind-break trees along the upper-most ridges with the trees and crops that require more sunlight and wind protection located lower on the farm's south sloping land. The existing trees are a near single species of spruce resulting from a prior clear-cut, but the new trees will be a diverse mix that may include maple, oak, poplar, birch, hemlock, and apple, among others.  The trees in rows will be arranged to allow for selective harvesting while some blocks will be left to grow unmanaged. Similiar to the trees, the crops that will be planted in the tree understory and between the rows of trees will also be more diverse.

<u>Image</u>: *Proposed new trees and storm-water collection pond laid over a sattelite image of the existing property on Prince Edward Island (gradient lines show how the land slopes toward the south where surface run-off water collects). A - water erosion down the centre of this field is already evident, but can be controlled by the new rows of trees that follow field contours. B - this prior clear-cut will be diversified to a range of native tree species. C - there will be relatively little change to this field apart from re-aligning the existing windbreak so it follows natural contours and then adding a second row at the lowest and steepest part of the field. D - Greenhouse.  Note that the proposed changes will be gradual and are likely to take decades to complete.*

Some reasons for our transition to agroforestry are listed below:

- Productivity: Trees will reduce the higher wind speeds expected in the future and they will slow drainage from more extreme rainfall, both of which will help control soil erosion.  The lower wind speeds will also reduce damage to wind sensitive crops and, while increased tree shade will slow the growth of some crops, it will be beneficial to others as mid-afternoons become hotter. Waste tree and crop biomass will be used to provide lower cost and carbon negative heat, electricity, and char (carbon) for the greenhouses and soil.

- Biodiversity: A more diverse mix of plants and wildlife will help mitigate climate induced pest, disease, and fire risks while also making the property more interesting to live on or visit.  

- Diversify outputs: Investments will be made in greenhouses with trees providing higher value wood and fruit.  Work is leveled since much tree and greenhouse work can be done during times when field crops are not being harvested.  Net income is not expected to increase, but it should be more stable and more adaptable to change. 
  
- Timing: High-value trees require a long lead-time to grow and should be planted before changes to climate make them more difficult to establish.  

## Management

We are, or plan to, use these methods for managing our agroforesty practice.

**BIM (Building Information Management)**

Building Information Management (BIM) tools are being used for design of out-buildings (greenhouses, sheds, workshop, garage, ...).  These use simple sloped-roof buildings which can be combined to form larger buildings if needed.  A tool for converting a mark-down text document to a model suitable for costing (but not construction) is being developed as illustrated below.

</p>

The main goal of BIM in our case, however, is to manage the farm's asset data over time (e.g. trees, soil conditions, crop yields, and infrastructure). This is possible since industry is expanding the underlying BIM file system ([IFC5](https://www.buildingsmart.org/ifc-for-site-landscape-and-urban-planning-call-for-participation/)) to also include infrastructure and landscaping, thereby making it relevant to agroforestry.  The IFC5 standard should be especially useful in regions where it is used by local government for the surrounding public works (roads, drainage, other infrastructure). 

This ability to scientifically record and then manage large amounts of agroforestry data using an open standard is of high value to this project and it may also prove useful to researchers modelling carbon negative agroforestry systems.  This git repository will the workflow and FreeCAD/Blender models.

**Cogeneration of heat, power, treated water, and fertilizer with carbon sinking**

Small farm agroforestry produces woody biomass that, through gassification, can be used to produce heat (e.g. for greenhouses), electricity, treat water, and with some designs, produce fertilizer and [char](https://biochar-international.org/sustainability-climate-change/) (solid carbon) which can be used as a soil ammendment or sold as a [product](https://national-carbon.com/). A schematic showing design objectives for our application is shown below.

</p>

The technologies for converting biomass to energy and other products has received strong research and development support from most governments where climate change is a priority since it is one of the very few that can realistically be carbon-negative, be deployed at scale, and become cost-effective.  A good summary of the research done in this area is provided by this [Energy and Environmental Science Article](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2016/ee/c6ee00935b) article from the Royal Society of Chemistry.

In Canada, given the vast amount of biomass available, the technology is promising but generally remains cost-prohibitive.  Some cost-reduction will be achieved over the next few decades through improvements to the equipment itself, however, equipment may only account for about 1/3 of the total installed cost.  To reach cost targets, improvements will also need to be made to the way project capital is raised and managed with one promising way to do this outlined below under the heading of Smart Contracts.

**Smart Contracts**: Smart (automated) contracts that help manage project capital, when combined with the technologies that are now reorganizing supply chains, could make agroforestry more cost competitive and thus lead to higher rates of carbon capture. The smart contract platforms that are energy efficient (i.e. do not rely on proof-of-work) are still in early development but they are likely to mature over the next decade given the large amounts of speculative capital that has been flowing into that technology sector.  

The paper listed below from the US Federal Reserve (St Louis), the OASIS Standards Body - Baseline Protocol, and the Ernst & Young blockchain intiative summarize the opportunities and tools that are most relevant to our agroforestry project.

## Owners

Nancy and Brenon Knaggs both grew up on small farms. During their working careers Nancy helped manage new technology product development. Brenon worked in the engineering design of low-carbon cogeneration power systems and later in project management for large public infrastructure projects. They both have a keen interest in the relation between small farms, communities, and biodiversity within a time of changing climate and technology.
