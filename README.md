## Overview

Hundred Year Farms refers to two small farm properties (each about 43 acres); one on Prince Edward Island and the other in Manitoba. For both farms our plan is to make a gradual transition to Agroforestry.  Agroforesty involves the planting of crops, including grains, fruits, or vegetables, between rows of trees.  We believe that this type of farming, when combined with a greenhouse, can be made so that it becomes carbon-negative while maintaining food production, rebuilding topsoil, and maintaining habitat. That, over the next 100 years, should lead to higher long-term asset values than would otherwise be the case and make the farms more interesting to live on and visit.

**Farm Plan (PEI)**

Our plan for the island farm, as shown by the superposition of trees onto the sattelite image below, is to plant strong wind-break trees along the uppermost ridge with the trees and crops that require more sunlight and wind protection located lower on the farm's south sloping land. The existing trees are a near single species of spruce from a prior clear-cut, but the new trees will be a more diverse mix of maple, oak, poplar, birch, hemlock, and apple, among others.  The trees in rows will be arranged to allow for selective harvesting while some blocks will be left to grow unmanaged.  A greenhouse will be incorporated into this agroforestry system.

A - water erosion down the centre of this field is evident, but can be controlled by the new rows of trees that follow field contours. B - prior clear-cut area. C - windbreak realligned to follow land contours. D - Greenhouse.*

Some of the goals we are trying to achieve include:

- Erosion Control: Trees in rows reduce wind speeds and slow drainage during extreme weather.  
- Biodiversity: Mitigates pest and fire risk while making the property more interesting to visit.  
- Diversification: Greenhouses and high-value trees provide income independent of field crops and distribute work over the year.   

Agroforestry is a well-established practice that we will be adapting, with the help of various experts, to our sites.  Implementation will be gradual and is likely to require decades to complete or it may be inter-generational.  While our proposed agroforestry is not unique, where we will be doing some original work is in our approach to supplying greenhouse utilities from the agro-forestry waste biomass.  Those utility services are what could allow this farm to become carbon negative and have reduced operating costs.  

**Carbon-negative integrated greenhouse**

Agroforestry produces significant amounts of waste biomass that must be managed.  Through gassification this waste can be used to produce heat (e.g. for greenhouses), gas, electricity, treated water, fertilizer, and [char](https://biochar-international.org/sustainability-climate-change/) (solid carbon) which can be used as a carbon sequestering [soil ammendment or other products](https://national-carbon.com/). A schematic showing design objectives for our integrated greenhouse application is shown below.

</p>

The core technologies for using waste wood and waste crop biomass to provide utility services have received strong research and development support from governments where climate change is a priority.  That is because the technology is one of the very few that integrates so completely with the natural environment, can realistically become carbon-negative, be fabricated by any modern country with common metals, and deployed at scale.  A good summary of the gassification technology is provided by this [Energy and Environmental Science Article](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2016/ee/c6ee00935b) from the Royal Society of Chemistry.

However, while the core gassification technology is proven, practical systems today remain cost-prohibitive.  Some cost-reduction will be achieved over the next few decades through improvements to equipment, but faster and more significant cost reductions are likely to be from:

1. Improving system integration to provide all utility services as illustrated above. 
1. Using automation (e.g. Smart Contracts) to lower the cost of project capital and administration. 

The diagram below expands upon the second bullet.  The first panel in the diagram depicts conventional project financing from investor shares for either equipment manufacture, an installation, or regional support services.  The second panel depicts a form of financing, known as a cooperative, that is sometimes used when a project's returns are too low to interest investor-led financing, but where there is a high social purpose.  The third panel proposes to lower the administrative cost of social purpose cooperatives using smart contracts.

</p>

A recent example of cooperative financing, using a project structure similiar to that in the second panel, is given by the [low-carbon biogas-from-waste project](https://www.torontozoo.com/tz/biogas) at the Toronto Zoo.  They were able to organize their project as a cooperative since their project had a social purpose and that allowed them to raise money by selling bonds at 5% as opposed to the 15% or more that an investor led project would requiree.  The proposed use of smart contracts, as shown in the third panel, potentially could further lower the cost of such social purpose (e.g. carbon negative) cooperatives.

- [Ernst & Younge Blockchain Initiative](https://blockchain.ey.com/)

The degree to which improved system integration and smart contracts could bring forward carbon-negative agroforestry is a subject of the feasibility study.     

**Data**

We are using a 3D file system based on the [BIM-IFC5 standard](https://www.buildingsmart.org/ifc-for-site-landscape-and-urban-planning-call-for-participation/) whose scope now includes the type of infrastructure, landscaping, structures, and engineering systems relevant to our project as illustrated below.   

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hundredyearfarms/Hundred-Year-Farms/main/BIM-githubReadme.svg" alt="BIM Models" width="600">
</p>

While the main reason for using the Building Information Management (BIM-IFC5) file system is to manage the farm's asset data over time (e.g. trees, soil conditions, crop yields, and infrastructure) as shown in the panel to the left, the same BIM tools (e.g. FreeCAD, Blender) are useful for design of the out-buildings (greenhouses, sheds, workshop, garage, and later the engineered vessel and piping systems...) as shown in the panel to the right.  

## Schedule:  

Over the course of 2021 we will refine the above concept design with the help of consultants.  Following that will be a [feasibility study](https://guides.co/g/vital-steps-a-cooperative-feasibility-study-guide/85047) that considers the state of technology, standards, regulations, and tax treatments for the integrated greenhouse and its related smart contracts.  The feasibility study is not expected to change our concept, but rather will tell us how quickly the integrated greenhouse technology can be implemented and the scope of our activities.  As is typical in physical (non-software) project work, following feasibility will be development of the preliminary designs, one of which will be down-selected for detailed design and then plans generated for implementation. Implemenation may be within this decade or, if the smart contracts are not workable, we may need to plan for an inter-generational transition to carbon-negative agroforestry.  

## Owners

Nancy and Brenon Knaggs both grew up on small farms. During their working careers Nancy helped manage new technology product development. Brenon worked in the engineering design of low-carbon cogeneration power systems and later in project management for large public infrastructure projects. They both have a keen interest in the relation between small farms, communities, and biodiversity within a time of changing climate and technology.
