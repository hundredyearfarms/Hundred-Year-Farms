## Overview

Hundred Year Farms refers to two small farm properties (each about 43 acres); one on Prince Edward Island and the other in Manitoba. For both farms our plan is to make a gradual transition to Agroforestry.  Agroforesty involves the planting of crops, including grains, fruits, or vegetables, between rows of trees.  We believe that this type of farming, when combined with a greenhouse, can be made so that it becomes carbon-negative while maintaining food production, rebuilding topsoil, and maintaining habitat. That, in turn, should lead to higher long-term asset values than would otherwise be the case and make the farms more interesting to visit over the next 100 years.

**Farm Plan (PEI)**

Our plan for the island farm, as shown by the superposition of trees onto the sattelite image below, is to plant strong wind-break trees along the uppermost ridge with the trees and crops that require more sunlight and wind protection located lower on the farm's south sloping land. The existing trees are a near single species of spruce resulting from a prior clear-cut, but the new trees will be a more diverse mix that may include maple, oak, poplar, birch, hemlock, and apple, among others.  The trees in rows will be arranged to allow for selective harvesting while some blocks will be left to grow unmanaged.  One or more greenhouses will be incorporated into this farm system.

A - water erosion down the centre of this field is evident, but can be controlled by the new rows of trees that follow field contours. B - prior clear-cut area. C - windbreak realligned to follow land contours. D - Greenhouse.*

Some of the reasons for our transitioning to agroforestry with greenhouse include:

- Erosion Control: Trees in rows reduce wind speeds and slow drainage during extreme weather.  
- Biodiversity: Mitigates pest and fire risk while making the property more interesting to visit.  
- Diversification: Greenhouses and high-value trees provide income independent of field crops and distribute work over the year.   

For managing data, we are using a 3D file system ([BIM-IFC5 for infrastructure and landscaping](https://www.buildingsmart.org/ifc-for-site-landscape-and-urban-planning-call-for-participation/)) as illustrated below.

</p>

Some of the conventional Building Information Management (BIM) tools are being used to design out-buildings (greenhouses, sheds, workshop, garage, ...) as illustrated in the panel to the left.  However, the main purpose of this file system is to manage the farm's asset data over time (e.g. trees, soil conditions, crop yields, and infrastructure) as shown in the panel to the right.

**Carbon-negative integrated greenhouse**

Agroforestry as described above is an established practice.  Where we will be doing some original work is in our approach to supplying greenhouse utilities from waste biomass.  That is what could allow this farm to become carbon negative and potentially more profitable.  This is what we consider our unique product.  

In general, agroforestry produces significant amounts of waste biomass that must be managed.  Through gassification this waste can be used to produce heat (e.g. for greenhouses), gas, electricity, treated water, and with some designs, fertilizer and [char](https://biochar-international.org/sustainability-climate-change/) (solid carbon) which can be used as a soil ammendment or sold as a [product](https://national-carbon.com/). A schematic showing the long-term design objectives for our greenhouse integrated application is shown below.

</p>

The technologies for using waste wood and waste crop biomass to provide utility services have received strong research and development support from governments where climate change is a priority.  That is because the technology is one of the very few that integrates so completely with the natural environment, can realistically become carbon-negative, be fabricated by any modern country, and deployed at scale.  A good summary of the core gassification technology is provided by this [Energy and Environmental Science Article](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2016/ee/c6ee00935b) from the Royal Society of Chemistry, with practical examples of use listed below.

However, while the core technology is proven, practical systems today are generally cost-prohibitive.  Some cost-reduction will be achieved over the next few decades through improvements to equipment, but these reductions are likely to continue being marginal and slow.  Faster and more significant cost reduction opportunities are likely to be those from:

1. Improving system integration to provide all utility services as illustrated above (i.e. not just heat and electricity). 
1. Using automation (e.g. Smart Contracts) to lower the cost of project capital and administration. 

The paper listed below from the US Federal Reserve, the OASIS Standards Body - Baseline Protocol, and the Ernst & Young blockchain intiative summarize the opportunities and tools most relevant to the second bullet above. 

- [US Federal Reserve - Smart Contract Research Report](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/2021/02/05/decentralized-finance-on-blockchain-and-smart-contract-based-financial-markets)

The first panel in the diagram below depicts conventional project financing from investor shares.  The second panel depicts a common, but less frequently used, form of financing for projects with a social purpose known as a cooperative.  The third panel proposes to improve upon the social purpose cooperative using smart contracts to the extent they become feasible over the next decade.    

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hundredyearfarms/Hundred-Year-Farms/main/SMARTCONTRACTS.svg" alt="Smart Contract Cooperatives" width="800">
</p>

To illustrate the significance of more efficient financing, a recent [low-carbon biogas-from-waste project](https://www.torontozoo.com/tz/biogas) at the Toronto Zoo (completed in 2021) used a project structure similiar to that in the second panel.  They were able to organize their project as a cooperative since the surrounding community viewed their project as having a social purpose and this allowed them to raise money by selling bonds to those in the surrounding area at 5% as opposed to the 15% or more that an investor led project would require.  For that $5M project, the difference between having to return capital at 5% versus 15% is a more significant cost reduction than could have been acheived through equipment design.  

The proposed smart contract technology, as shown in the third panel, potentially could be used to lower the cost of that approach further whether it is for equipment manufacture, or a system installation. This may be especially important for the smaller social purpose (e.g. carbon negative) projects in which the cost of finance management can be prohibitive.  How significant improved system integration and smart contracts could bring forward low-carbon technologies is a subject of our upcoming feasibility study.  

## Schedule:  

We are at the concept design stage and over the course of 2021 will continue to refine it with the help of consultants.  Following that will be a [feasibility study](https://guides.co/g/vital-steps-a-cooperative-feasibility-study-guide/85047) that considers the state of technology (e.g. IFC5, co-generation, and smart contracts) as well as the relevant industry standards and government regulations.  The feasibility study is not expected to change our overall concept for carbon-negative agroforestry, but rather will tell us how quickly the greenhouse integrated co-generation system can be implemented and the scope of our activities.  Following feasibility will be the preliminary designs, then the down-selected detailed design, then a business plan for implementation. Implemenation very well may end up being within this decade or we may need to plan for a more gradual inter-generational transition to carbon-negative agroforestry.  

## Owners

Nancy and Brenon Knaggs both grew up on small farms. During their working careers Nancy helped manage new technology product development. Brenon worked in the engineering design of low-carbon cogeneration power systems and later in project management for large public infrastructure projects. They both have a keen interest in the relation between small farms, communities, and biodiversity within a time of changing climate and technology.
