## Overview

Hundred Year Farms refers to two small farm properties (each about 43 acres); one on Prince Edward Island and the other in Manitoba. For both farms our plan is to make a gradual transition to Agroforestry.  Agroforesty involves the planting of varied crops, including grains, fruits, or vegetables, between rows of trees. We believe that we can make this type of farming carbon-negative with the use of advanced co-generation and the emerging smart-contract technologies.

Through this change to carbon-negative agroforestry it will be more likely that we can maintain the farm's habitat, conserve water, and build high-value topsoil as the climate changes. That, in turn, should lead to higher long-term asset values than would otherwise be the case, while also making the farms much more interesting and more enjoyable to visit for the next 100 years.

## Farm Plan (PEI)

There are five basic types of agroforestry practices in North America: windbreaks, alley cropping, silvopasture, riparian buffers, and forest farming. Alley cropping, which is the cultivation of crops between rows of trees, will be used on the island farm.  

Our plan for the island farm, as shown by the superposition of trees onto the sattelite image below, is to plant strong wind-break trees along the upper-most ridges with the trees and crops that require more sunlight and wind protection located lower on the farm's south sloping land. The existing trees are a near single species of spruce resulting from a prior clear-cut, but the new trees will be a diverse mix that may include maple, oak, poplar, birch, hemlock, and apple, among others.  The trees in rows will be arranged to allow for selective harvesting while some blocks will be left to grow unmanaged. Similiar to the trees, the crops that will be planted in the tree understory and between the rows of trees will also be more diverse.

<u>Image</u>: *Proposed new trees and storm-water collection pond laid over a sattelite image of the existing property on Prince Edward Island (gradient lines show how the land slopes toward the south where surface run-off water collects). A - water erosion down the centre of this field is already evident, but can be controlled by the new rows of trees that follow field contours. B - this prior clear-cut will be diversified to a range of native tree species. C - there will be relatively little change to this field apart from re-aligning the existing windbreak so it follows natural contours and then adding a second row at the lowest and steepest part of the field. D - Greenhouse.  Note that the proposed changes will be gradual and are likely to take decades to complete.*

Some reasons for our transition to agroforestry are listed below:

- Productivity: Trees will reduce the higher wind speeds expected in the future and they will slow drainage from more extreme rainfall, both of which will help control soil erosion.  The lower wind speeds will also reduce damage to wind sensitive crops and, while increased tree shade will slow the growth of some crops, it will be beneficial to others as mid-afternoons become hotter. Waste tree and crop biomass will be used to provide lower cost and carbon negative heat, electricity, and char (carbon) for the greenhouses and soil.

- Biodiversity: A more diverse mix of plants and wildlife will help mitigate climate induced pest, disease, and fire risks while also making the property more interesting to live on or visit.  

- Diversify outputs: Investments will be made in greenhouses while the farmland will become better suited to grazing, provide higher value wood and fruit, while still being able to produce vegetables, forage and grains.  Work over the course of the year will be leveled as, for example, much tree and greenhouse work can be done during times when field crops are not being harvested.  Net income is not expected to increase, but it should be more stable and more adaptable to change. 
  
- Timing: High-value trees require a long lead-time to grow and should be planted before changes to climate make them difficult to establish.  

## Management

We are, or plan to, use these methods for managing our agroforesty practice.

**BIM (Building Information Management)**

Building Information Management (BIM) tools are being used for design of the farm layout, the buildings, and infrastructure, but with the eventual goal of using it to manage the farm's asset data over time (e.g. trees, soil conditions, crop yields, as well as buildings and infrastructure, ...). While often associated with the design of buildings, industry is expanding the underlying BIM file system ([IFC5](https://www.buildingsmart.org/ifc-for-site-landscape-and-urban-planning-call-for-participation/)) to also include infrastructure and landscaping, thereby making it relevant to agroforestry (especially where the IFC standard is used by local government for the surrounding public works). Apart from farm management, this 3D file system may prove useful to researchers studying, or modelling the performance of, urban and rural agroforestry with carbon-sequestration.  This git repository was set up to hold the workflow and FreeCAD/Blender model.

**Cogeneration of heat and power with carbon sinking**

Small farm agroforestry produces waste biomass that must be managed. Through gassification this debris can be used to produce heat (e.g. for greenhouses), electricity, and with some designs, [char](https://biochar-international.org/sustainability-climate-change/) (solid carbon) which can be used as a soil ammendment or sold as a [product](https://national-carbon.com/). 

This technology receives strong research and development support from most governments where climate change is priority since it is one of the very few that can realistically be carbon-negative, be deployed at scale, and become cost-effective.  In Canada the technology is cost-prohibitive and there is only so much cost-reduction that will be achieved over the next decade through improvements to the equipment itself.  Improvements will also need to be made to the way capital is raised and managed with one promising way to do this outlined below under the heading of Smart Contracts.

**Smart Contracts**: Smart (automated) contracts that help manage project capital, when combined with the technologies that are now reorganizing supply chains, could make agroforestry projects more cost competitive and thus lead to higher rates of carbon capture. The smart contract platforms that are energy efficient (i.e. do not rely on proof-of-work) are still in early development but are likely to mature over the next decade, or perhaps sooner, given the large amounts of speculative capital that has been flowing into that technology sector.  

While still based on an emerging technology, those platforms are far enough along to begin planning for their long-term use in project contract work.  The paper listed below from the US Federal Reserve (St Louis), the OASIS Standards Body - Baseline Protocol, and the Ernst & Young blockchain intiative summarize the opportunities and tools that may be application to agroforestry related project work.

## Owners

Nancy and Brenon Knaggs both grew up on small farms. During their working careers Nancy helped manage new technology product development.
